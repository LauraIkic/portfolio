    "text": "I developed a dynamic cryptocurrency trading platform using Java Spring, designed to provide users with a secure and seamless experience. The system allows users to sign up, log in with JWT authentication, and manage their portfolio with ease. User data is safely stored in a MySQL database, ensuring privacy and security.\n\nThe platform integrates real-time cryptocurrency data through the Gecko API, which is then streamed to Kafka for continuous updates. Users can place orders to buy coins at live market prices, and these orders are added to a market where they are executed as soon as a matching buy/sell order is found. Once an order is completed, the purchased coins are added to the user’s portfolio, allowing them to track and manage their assets. While limit orders are not yet implemented, this feature is planned for future releases.\n\nThis project showcases my ability to combine various technologies, including Spring Boot, MySQL, Kafka, and external APIs, to create a robust, real-time application that provides a smooth and responsive user experience.",

  "date": "",
  "text": "The City Guide project is an innovative combination of machine learning and augmented reality (AR) that aims to enhance the travel experience. The project is divided into two main components: an image recognition system and an AR experience, with a primary focus on the latter. Image Recognition Component The first component of the project involves capturing images through a camera and analyzing them with the help of a Vision API. This API is designed to detect landmarks within the captured image and return relevant information. The results are cross-referenced with a database that holds additional details about each landmark, allowing for further exploration. Additionally, the coordinates of the nearest landmark are calculated, helping the system understand the user’s exact location. Augmented Reality Experience Once the image recognition system has detected a landmark, the project activates an AR session. Using the coordinates of the landmark, a virtual 3D object is positioned in the user's environment, displaying the name of the landmark. Users can interact with the object by tapping on it, which brings up a detailed view of the landmark, offering additional information",

    "text": "The Tamago App is a delightful and interactive virtual pet game inspired by the classic Tamagotchi, but with a magical twist. In this game, you start by choosing one of two mystical dragon eggs: the Fire Egg or the Water Egg. Each egg brings its own unique set of challenges and care routines, creating a fun and engaging experience for players. Once you’ve selected your egg, it’s time to begin your journey as a dragon caretaker. If you choose the Water Egg, you’ll notice it becoming covered in grime and dirt as time goes by. To keep it healthy and happy, you’ll need to use a sponge to carefully clean the egg, ensuring it stays in top condition for the next stage of its growth. On the other hand, if you opt for the Fire Egg, it will periodically freeze over, and you must use a fire source to gently thaw it out, ensuring it remains warm and safe. Both of these eggs require your constant attention, as each one needs specific care at regular intervals. These tasks must be repeated over time, providing a fun challenge as you work to nurture the egg and prepare it for the momentous hatching. The ultimate goal is to help your dragon grow strong enough to hatch, bringing a new magical creature into the world.",
